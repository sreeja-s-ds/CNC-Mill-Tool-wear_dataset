This repository presents a predictive maintenance project based on the CNC Mill Tool Wear dataset.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 18 time-series CSV files, each corresponding to a separate milling experiment (experiment_01.csv through experiment_18.csv). Each experiment captures sensor data from a CNC machine operating under different tool conditions, feed rates, and clamping pressures. Each file contains several thousand rows representing time-series readings from the start to the end of each experiment.

In addition, a train.csv file provides metadata for each experiment.

The dataset is suitable for various machine learning tasks, including:​

🔍Tool Wear Detection: Classifying tools as worn or unworn based on sensor data.

🔍Predictive Maintenance: Forecasting tool wear progression to schedule timely maintenance.

🔍Process Optimization: Analyzing the impact of feed rate and clamping pressure on tool wear and machining quality.​

By leveraging the rich sensor data and detailed experiment metadata, researchers and engineers can develop models to enhance manufacturing efficiency and product quality.
